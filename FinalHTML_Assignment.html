            <p><b>Depression</b> (major depressive disorder) is a common and 
                serious medical illness that negatively affects how you 
                feel, the way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it 
                is also treatable. <b>Depression</b> causes feelings of sadness 
                and/or a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed.
                <b>Depression</b>, in psychology, a mood or emotional state that 
                is marked by feelings of low self-worth or guilt and a 
                reduced ability to enjoy life. Examples of other types of 
                depressive disorders newly added to the diagnostic 
                classification of <a href="http://www.dsm5.org/about/Pages/Default.aspx">DSM-5</a> include disruptive mood 
                dysregulation disorder (diagnosed in children and 
                adolescents) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).
                Not everyone who is depressed experiences every symptom. 
                Some people experience only a few symptoms while others may 
                experience many. Several persistent symptoms in addition to
                low mood are required for a diagnosis of major <b>depression</b>,
                but people with only a few symptoms may benefit from 
                treatment of their “subsyndromal” <b>depression</b>.
